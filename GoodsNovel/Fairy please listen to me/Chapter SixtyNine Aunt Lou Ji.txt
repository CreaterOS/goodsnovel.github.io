Cough cough, belated testimonials.

Originally, I wanted to write the testimonial after coding this episode, but I overestimated my coding speed. I didn’t finish coding the plot, and I didn’t have time to write the testimonial.

Yes, after more than two weeks of saving, I have saved four chapters for manuscripts. I thought there would be about ten chapters...

Cough, people’s physiques can’t be generalized. My codewords belong to the kind of turtles crawling. It is basically supernormal to be able to figure out a thousand words in an hour. Sometimes I can sit in front of a notebook for more than 4,000 words a day. Hour.

Moreover, this book only has a rough outline, and many specific plots are read while writing. This kind of writing method is easy to write and suddenly find that the plot has reached a dead end. Every time this happens, you can only groan Then delete the text and rewrite it.

Well, anyway, I will work hard to code.

In fact, it's quite surprising how far this book has come.

I woke up one day and suddenly saw my collection skyrocketing. Only after reading the comments did I realize that an old man pushed my book on the starting point, and it was also popular on the post bar. I searched but couldn’t find it. Thank you for pushing the book onz.

And I see that many readers say that the title of Fairy's book is very bad. In fact, I also feel this, but I can't help it. Now I have spent countless brain cells to come up with this title. . . .

Then there is the plot, as mentioned in the book, a world is too big, it is unrealistic to describe it exhaustively with words, but I will try my best to ensure that each character's motivation and IQ are on the line.

Hmm...that's about it.

Belatedly ask for the first order.
