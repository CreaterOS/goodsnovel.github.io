The next day, when Chen Changsheng brought the city police officers from afar to escort the mad villagers back to the city, Yuan Yutang heard another bad news like a bolt from the blue.

In just a few days, with Guobei County as the center, there were drastic changes in many villages within a radius of tens of miles. The villagers seemed to have gone crazy overnight, killing each other like crazy.

There is no place in Nuoda Guobei County that is stable anymore.

It was also thanks to Yan Chixia's great face that Chen Changsheng was able to find a few disgruntled arresters from the short-staffed yamen to clean up the mess.

Upon hearing this news, both Yuan Yutang and Bai Yun's hearts sank.

It seems that the arrival of strange monsters is imminent.
