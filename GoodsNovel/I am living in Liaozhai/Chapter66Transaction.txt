Some scholars once said that the barbarians are actually a branch of the Xia people. It is likely that the ancestors in ancient times left their homes and went deep into the endless forests in order to escape the war. After years of evolution, they formed the barbarians.

It's a pity that this rebellious doctrine is destined to be impossible to be recognized in mainstream society.

Because the proud Xia people boast that they are the people of heaven, and they are the most advanced nation in the world. How could they have anything to do with the ignorant and backward barbarians who drink blood like hair.

But if you put aside your prejudices, the Xia people and the barbarians still have something in common, especially their appearance.

If skin color is ignored, it is basically difficult to distinguish Xia people from barbarians.
