"Roar~"

A deafening and terrifying tiger's howl suddenly exploded, causing the floating thick fog to roll incessantly.

Immediately, two black figures, one large and one small, collided fiercely in the rolling fog.

Huh~

A sharp tiger claw the size of a millstone wrapped in a fierce wind like a knife, whistling and shooting out, it was astonishing as hell.

Yuan Yutang was calm and unhurried, with a flash of golden light on his body, he moved twenty feet away in an instant.

Just when he was about to regroup and kill the tiger demon again.

Suddenly, he suddenly felt chills in his vest, and goose bumps all over his body.

Before he had time to think about it, he instinctively rushed forward.
