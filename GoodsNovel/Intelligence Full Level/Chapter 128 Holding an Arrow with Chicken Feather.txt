In the blink of an eye, a hundred years have passed.

Lin Long's body remained in the Dragon God Realm, watching the twenty-four Dinghai Pearls waiting for the refinement to be completed.

And above the prehistoric times, many major events have happened in a hundred years.

The little Penglai in the East China Sea began to stagnate and no longer expanded. The East Prince restrained his forces and preserved one side of the territory.

The forces that were originally assembled by relying on conquests, after the last incident, unexpectedly began to stabilize.

Dong Wanggong's change surprised everyone in Honghuang.

Such an ambitious guy can actually control his ambition.

Of course, there are also many creatures who are guessing that the East Prince must have been too stimulated last time, and has no intention of participating in the prehistoric hegemony.

There are also creatures who know the truth and understand that the Eastern Prince dare not expand.

However, no matter what, it is a good thing that Prince Dong and his subordinate Xianmeng no longer cause trouble.

In this regard, all the creatures in the wilderness also breathed a sigh of relief in their hearts.

After all, without the Yaozu and Wuzu, if Duke Dong continues to fight like this, Honghuang may really usher in the first real overlord.

But no one who has achieved success in cultivation would wish to have such a powerful force over his head.

And besides that, there is another big thing.

Speaking of which, this major event is directly related to the Yaozu.

The demon emperor Jun has actually become a Taoist partner with a demon god of the demon clan in the past hundred years!

As soon as the news came out, it immediately caused an uproar in Honghuang!

In the impression of all living beings in the prehistoric world, Di Jun has always been ambitious above all else. Apart from unifying the prehistoric world and strengthening the monster clan, he should have no other thoughts.

But it was such a demon emperor who quietly had a Taoist companion.

This really caused all the single dogs in Honghuang to be stuffed with a handful of dog food that didn't taste good.

And Lin Long's avatar has been traveling outside, and he was a little surprised when he heard the news, but he immediately understood that this 100% was Hongjun's handwriting.

He wanted to use his knowledge of the future to speculate on Hongjun's plan this time, but he was not so lucky this time.

Because this incident had nothing to do with him, not even Dragon God Realm, so Lin Long didn't get any useful information.

Of course, even if he didn't deduce Hongjun's intention, based on Lin Long's understanding of Hongjun, it's not difficult to guess the old guy's purpose.

It's very simple, because what Hongjun wants to do most now is to bring the Lich clan back to the Great Desolate World, and let the two clans fight.

In this way, it will be possible to promote the flood and calamity, so as to achieve the goal of Hongjun.

What Lin Long has to do now is to be careful, once he finds something wrong, he will immediately kill it without any hesitation.

After all, as time went by, Lin Long's state continued to improve.

As for Hongjun, although he was holding back, Lin Long did not believe that Hongjun would not improve at all these years.

He and Hongjun had already torn their faces apart, and both of them wished to kill each other immediately.

At this time, if Hongjun was allowed to break through the realm before himself, this guy would desperately find the Dragon God Realm to erase his existence.

Therefore, Hongjun must be slowed down, and his practice speed cannot be increased!


The days and years are long.

On this day, in the Dragon God Realm and the Dragon God Hall, a strange wave of dao rhyme came from the hall, stirring like water waves, one circle after another, each faster than the other.

In an instant, all the creatures in the Dragon God Realm were alarmed!

"Huh? It's the wave coming from the direction of the Dragon Temple!"

"It must be Lord Dragon God who is displaying some supernatural power."

In the Sanxiao Dojo.

Zhao Gongming, Sanxiao, and Liueared Macaque are all here.

After all, San Xiao is a woman, and the decoration of this dojo is also beautiful and comfortable. Whether it is Zhao Gongming or Six-eared Macaque, they all like this dojo.

As fellow students, these two guys would come to San Xiao to cheat for food and drink from time to time, and San Xiao was used to it.

Feeling the fluctuations from the Dragon Temple right now, the five disciples suddenly stood up.

"It's Master! Master is about to leave the customs!"

The six-eared macaque danced happily, and the reason was actually very simple. When Lin Long was retreating, the six-eared macaque had secretly made a decision that he must reach the realm of the Great Luo Jinxian before the master left the seclusion!

Now that I have been in Daluo Jinxian for hundreds of years, I scratch my head every day and want to praise myself after Lin Long leaves the customs.

As a senior brother, Zhao Gongming stood up and said, "Let's go, Master is going out of the gate. As disciples, we should welcome you."

Today's Zhao Gongming, under the tutelage of Lin Long and all the managers of the Dragon God Realm, is no longer the reckless man he used to be. Both his character and practice are much more stable.

In the blink of an eye, outside the Dragon God Palace, all the high-level officials from the Dragon God Realm had gathered.

It's just that everyone stood under the stone steps, but they didn't dare to go forward.

"Haha, it's done, it's done!"

I only heard Lin Long's laughter coming from the Dragon God Hall.

Everyone knew it was a good thing when they heard it, but they didn't step forward to disturb, but still waited respectfully.

After half a day, the gate of the Dragon Temple finally opened slowly.

In the main hall, Lin Long, wearing a blue robe and full of joy, came out.

"Hehe, they're all here, get up when you're done, I'm happy today, so don't kneel here."

After Lin Long finished speaking, he waved his hand lightly. Under the stone steps, the knelt people, no matter whether it was the senior dragon clan or Zhao Gongming and others, had no strength to resist this force, and they were easily lifted up.

You must know that among the senior officials of the three clans present at this time, there is also the existence of Hunyuan Jinxian, that is, the quasi-sage.

After feeling Lin Long's power, the children of the three clans who were lucky enough to break through to the Hunyuan Golden Immortal were shocked in their eyes!

"Lord Dragon God's strength has improved again!"

"No, maybe it's not that Lord Dragon God has been promoted again, but that we have never seen the real strength of Lord Dragon God!"

It was a dragon clan and a phoenix clan who spoke, and this is also the steward of these two clans.

The so-called stewardship is to manage the entire ethnic group, and they only obey Lin Long, and their status is very important.

As for the ancestor dragon Yuanfeng and Shi Qilin back then, although Lin Long blackmailed Hongjun and released them, they had no intention of competing for supremacy, so they found a cave in Sanxian Island and closed their lives to practice.

The three clans have lived together for so long, and they have already reconciled from the original incident.

After all, the three clans suffered heavy losses back then, and they were calculated by Luo Hu and Hongjun, so there is no need to keep entangled in this kind of hatred.

Now being able to live in this small world, rich in resources, without worrying about the troubles of the outside world, is simply the most ideal life.

Looking at the crowd, Lin Long's figure flickered, but before they could react at all, Lin Long had already appeared beside them.

The law of time and the law of space have been thoroughly integrated by Lin Long, every move is to affect the power of this law.

This is also what he realized when refining the twenty-four Dinghai Shenzhu.

The twenty-four stars themselves can evolve the twenty-four heavens, and it is not surprising that they contain some laws of time and space.

Lin Long, who was out of the customs, was in a good mood, looked at the three clans below, and asked.

"What's going on with the Yaozu recently?"

This was the focus of Hongjun's attention. Of course, he had to pay attention to everything.

Everyone thought about it, and finally the steward of the Feng clan stood up.

"My lord Dragon God, recently the Great Desolation has been at peace, and nothing major has been discovered, but there is one small matter."

Hearing her slightly contradictory words, Lin Long frowned: "Huh? What's the matter?"

"Reporting to Lord Dragon God, Di Jun has given birth to a son, which is a recent sensation among the Yaozu."
