Chapter Forty-One

move place

Yan Lu, it seems that he is indeed not here, and there are so many people around, why don't we go now.

Yan Lu looked around and indeed saw a dense crowd of people. Yan Lu did not expect that the two of them would cause such a commotion here. She also saw several famous professors in medicine among the crowd. I know things are getting bigger.

Okay, let's go quietly, otherwise there will be more and more people here.

So the two left this place together and walked outside the school.

When the two had just walked out of the school gate, they saw a person riding a tricycle on the opposite side, and both of them felt familiar.

Momo, quickly see if that person looks like Li Pingfan.

Li Mo looked carefully, he was Li Pingfan, how could he be here, and he was riding a tricycle, and there were so many flowers and plants, did he accept private work?

Silently, you are going to deduct his salary. If he dares to take other jobs during work, does he still take you as a boss seriously? Yan Lu laughed.

When Li Mo heard what Yan Lu said, his cheeks turned rosy and he said, oh, stop making trouble, let's go and stop him.

Whoops, who is this? How did he get into the business of selling flowers and plants.

With this cynicism, Li Pingfan knew at a guess that it was Yan Lu who was speaking.

You must be looking for me, Li Pingfan said.

It's not that I came to you, it's that she wanted to ask you something, Yan Lu pointed to Li Mo, but this is not a place to talk, let's go somewhere else.

Li Pingfan nodded in response.

Li Pingfan followed the two girls to a villa.

Li Pingfan fell in love with this place as soon as he entered this place. If he rented a house here, it would be good to get it, Li Pingfan thought to himself.

There is an exclusive garden behind this villa, so that you can plant all kinds of spiritual herbs, elixir, plus the spiritual soil you brought back, plant ordinary herbs, and these herbs will also have a certain amount of aura after a year , so that he can increase his cultivation speed even more, maybe it is not impossible to break through to the fourth level of Qi training within three years, Li Pingfan thought to himself.

And the most important thing is that there is a very spacious room next to the garden, so that it is more convenient to take care of these future elixir, and this place is more than enough to set up a gathering array, and even a larger gathering array can be arranged , Of course, this requires more spirit-gathering grass. Judging from the current situation, only a small-scale spirit-gathering array can be arranged, but this is already very good, and it can already improve his cultivation speed. Li Pingfan silently said in his heart plan this.

Hey, flower seller, what are you thinking.

What do you need to ask, you know everything, Li Pingfan said simply.

Cut, boring.

Alright, Yan Lu, stop making trouble.

Come with me, Mr. Li, I do have something to ask you.

Alright, here we come.

Li Pingfan immediately changed his face, and Yan Lu stomped his feet in anger. Li Pingfan followed Li Mo to a dark room. From this dark room, it can be seen that the sound insulation here is definitely very good.

Mr. Li, I want to ask you, is it really the mission you accepted? No other meaning, I just want to confirm again.

Yes, I accept it.

I know, and you also know about me, so I want to beg you not to tell my father about my joining the Lanyu League, this matter is too involved.

If you just talk about this matter, then I can tell you clearly, you can rest assured that I will not talk about it, and the task I received is to ensure that you do not have any accidents this semester, and I will not do anything else Control, don't let me control.

Thank you very much. If I didn’t have you last night, I can’t imagine the consequences. So, I’d like to thank you sincerely. If you have any request, I will do my best to satisfy you, but I still want to ask You do me one more favor.

Li Pingfan said with a faint smile, you can say something first, and I will see how my ability is before deciding whether to help you or not.

Li Mo pursed his lips and said softly, I want you to move to my house.

Because after what happened yesterday, I know that I will not be safe no matter where I am in the future, so I need your help, but don't worry, I will definitely help you if you have any requirements here.

Li Pingfan laughed complacently in his heart after listening to it. He really had nowhere to look, and it took no effort to get here. He was just about to move into this place.

Li Pingfan agreed without even thinking about it, so that the other party still owes him a favor, and it can also help him improve his cultivation speed, so why not do it.

Li Mo was a little stunned. He didn't expect the other party to agree so quickly, and now he really felt like he had slipped into the other party's trap.

So the two quickly reached an agreement.

Mo Mo, you can figure it out, I am about to starve to death, Yan Lu said this after seeing Li Mo and Li Pingfan coming out of the house.

Sorry, wait for me to prepare, Li Mo said and left the villa.

Li Mo came back five minutes later, and several servants came in with various dishes at the door. Li Pingfan's eyes widened when he saw this. This was the biggest lunch he had ever had in this star field.

After a few people finished their lunch, Li Pingfan started to move.
