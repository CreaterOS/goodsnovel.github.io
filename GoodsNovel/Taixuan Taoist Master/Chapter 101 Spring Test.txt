Chapter 113: The Woman Who Enters the Tao with a Sword

There was a mess all over the stage.

In an instant.

These hopeful young seeds of the Qingxu Sect suffered heavy casualties, even Yan Nantian's son died tragically. After hearing such cold words from the instigator, countless people retreated one after another, with unconcealable fear in their eyes, as if Shen Yu had grown up. A figure even more terrifying than the Qingxu sect.

Shen Yu waved his hand lightly, and the wooden sword flew back into his sleeve in an instant.

The transparent lightsaber that killed Yan Yunyu earlier was nothing more than a sword of aura that he condensed with Taoist magic at will.

After killing, it will naturally dissipate.

Facing everyone's eyes, Shen Yu didn't show any expression.

The experience of this life, the knot of his heart lies in Nanhe City, the old house of the Shen family.

And all of this originated from Taoist Zhishan of Yunyang Temple.

So after the Shen family was destroyed, he changed his name and surname and sneaked into the deserted city in the northwest, killed Zhishan, and destroyed Yunyang temple.

But earlier, when he saw the clothes of those disciples, he finally remembered that when he was in the northwest, the disciples of Yunyang Temple had the same clothes.

It turned out that he was already an enemy, no wonder he looked bored.

Some finally came back to their senses, looking at the figure, in a trance.

On this high platform, Shen Yu only did two things.

One is painting, and the other is killing people.

The meanings of the two are completely different, but they show the same temperament in him.

overbearing.

ruthless.

There is no doubt.

Some people with deeper thoughts noticed more terrifying details.

He blocked the blow from Duanrenshan Yunxia mirror, and then sent hundreds of disciples back to Qingxu.

Then he condensed Qi to kill Yan Yunyu with a sword.

In all the movements between the two, Shen Yu's footsteps did not move a step from the beginning to the end, but he completely teased Yan Nantian, a profound practitioner, in the palm of his hand.

How much calculation and calmness does this require?

There is a comeback.

The wind and cloud above the nine heavens began to turmoil, and the aura scattered in all directions.

A majestic and murderous aura came from thousands of miles away, without any form, but it seemed to be scraped on the body by a knife.

Unmanned Yunxia Jing Wufeng took the initiative, very happy, as if meeting an old friend.

A majestic coercion descended in the air.

Shen Yu raised her head slightly, looking a little seriously.

He felt the aura that had stepped into the upper three realms, and after thinking about it, he felt that it was the real fairy Li Moran, the woman who entered the Tao with a knife in Broken Blade Mountain.

Hit the young ones, come the big ones, hit the big ones, come the old ones.

Shen Yu has naturally heard this sentence, which is well-known both in the world of common people and in the world of practice, and has a deep understanding.

And the next move of the other party also proved his idea.

The wind and cloud above the high-altitude round platform passed away into the distance, and the sun shone on the entire platform without any cover.

Everyone felt extremely cold.

Because as the powerful aura in the distant sky got closer and closer, everyone realized that it turned out to be a silver arc-shaped air wave.

It was the breath of some kind of weapon.

It's not sharp and swift sword energy.

It's an overbearing and invincible sword intent.

Shen Yu understood.

It turned out that the woman who was rumored to have entered Taoism with a knife slashed at him from thousands of miles away, without mercy.

This knife may have been used since he stepped on the round platform to defeat Yan Yunyu, or maybe even earlier.

With the passage of distance and time, the blade became less violent, but still very powerful, powerful enough to instantly destroy the lives of everyone on the stage.

Do not escape.

will die.

If he escapes, everyone on the stage will be buried with him first.


Shen Yu glanced at the ground.

Zhao Ji, who was seriously injured, felt the meaning, and with a flash, she grabbed the father and daughter of the Yang family and ran away.

At the same time, many practitioners also reacted and fled towards the distance.

Many of the city's rich and powerful families without any cultivation had nowhere to escape, and they all looked ashen and hid on the edge of the round platform.

First came the strong wind.

Boom!

The floating round platform moved dozens of feet across the air, and the bricks on the edge of the ground cracked countless network cracks, and began to spread crazily towards the center.

The entire high platform was crumbling.

Countless people screamed heart-piercingly.

Just the wind brought by the saber intent is already so terrifying, if the arc-shaped saber aura that comes immediately hits completely, what can be done at this altitude of hundreds of feet.

In the eyes of everyone, Yan Nantian, the only one who had hope to stop this blow, seemed to have lost his soul, hugging Yan Yunyu's body, his face was ashen, and he didn't move at all.

When all thoughts were lost, some people cried in horror.

"It's all that Shen Yu, if it wasn't for him, how could we be like this."

"That's right, he wanted to die and dragged us to die together, this bastard!"

"I don't want to die, I don't want to die!"

When people in the world encounter certain unsolvable things, they will subconsciously blame certain people and things for suffering and torture, so as to vent their fear and resentment.

There are all kinds of things in the world, grotesque, nothing more than that.

Countless voices containing complaints and curses sounded, as if they were pointing fingers.

It's just that amidst these self-defeating words, another shocked voice came.

"He He!"

Before the words fell, countless eyes looked forward with the desire to survive.

I saw that the back of the green shirt, which was as straight as a sword, had quietly walked to the top of the big stage at some point.

When the strong wind blew, the young man's clothes fluttered and his sleeves swayed like a fairy.


Shen Yu quietly watched the arc-shaped saber energy coming from the sky.

He could hear the words of those people behind him clearly, but he didn't pay any attention to them.

Because the human heart is the most unpredictable thing, and it is also the most difficult for people to look directly at.

What they said had nothing to do with what he was going to do.

The reason why he stands here is not for anyone.

It was just because the attitude and method of the other party's saber were too contemptuous, so this feeling made Shen Yu's unhappy mood even worse.

Changhong runs through the sun.

Shen Yu's right hand was completely covered in thick blood red.
