Shen Yu has been staying at the top of Yujing Mountain since she woke up.

There are five floors in Qiongtai, each of which has a rest room, where Shen Yu usually sleeps.

The breath above Yujing Mountain can heal the injuries in Shen Yu's body, so it is naturally an excellent place for healing.

At first, everyone deliberately talked with Shen Yu, but they found that the latter did not show any signs of emotional instability due to falling into the dust, so they were relieved.

Because Yan Shigu wanted to teach Li Wudi, he rarely came here these days.

Meng Gui seemed to be writing a book to record all the solutions to various difficulties encountered in his practice, so he didn't know where to hide all day long.

Su Mo is even more...
