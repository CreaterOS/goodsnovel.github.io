On the way back to Daozong's courtyard, a group of people seemed a little quiet.

Because of Yu Wenwen's personality, the others were still immersed in the previous battle.

As for Shen Yu, she didn't know what she thought of, so she remained silent.

Ling Jianzi still couldn't believe that it was over like that, so he whispered: "No matter how strong Uncle Yu's Extreme Realm is, that guy is also a famous practitioner in Qingcheng Mountain, why did he lose so easily?"

Yu Wenwen didn't look back, and said calmly: "He underestimated the enemy at the beginning, and naturally he didn't have the face to continue fighting after he was injured."

Ling Jianzi was silent again, with a troubled expression on his face, as if he hadn't figured out the logic for a long time.

underestimate the enemy......
