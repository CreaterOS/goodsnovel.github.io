An earth-shattering battle broke out in Neixiaohe Town, North County of Zhongzhou. When the sheriff in charge arrived with countless officers and soldiers from the Tang Dynasty, the entire town had been destroyed, and only countless boulders in the mountains stood quietly. Lying there, it seems to be telling the tragedy of this war.

It has been a long time since such a thing happened in the territory of Zhongzhou under the jurisdiction of Datang. In addition to reporting to the imperial court and the academy, Zhongzhou even launched a search and arrest operation to investigate the truth of this matter.

The sheriff of Beijun was a middle-aged man with a slender figure and a dignified expression. He frowned fiercely at the scene in front of him, and his mood was even worse.
