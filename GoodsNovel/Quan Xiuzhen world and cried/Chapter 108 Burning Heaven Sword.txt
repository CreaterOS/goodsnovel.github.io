As the title, Chapter 119 has been changed.

Because my head was a little dizzy during the day, I felt that some things were not written clearly, so I added 2,000 words in front of the 119th sheet, about the plot of Li Jiuchuan coming to find Lin Xiangtian.

If you are interested, go back and have a look. There is no change in the back, and it is still the original content. The main reason is that you cannot insert a chapter before Chapter 119, so you can only add it in Chapter 119.

It doesn't matter if you don't watch it, it doesn't affect the development of any part at all.

In addition, the update will be postponed to 12:00 noon tomorrow morning, sorry for the inconvenience!
Chapter 119 of "She Cried the Whole Cultivation Realm" is currently being edited, please wait a moment,
After the content is updated, please refresh the page again to get the latest update!
