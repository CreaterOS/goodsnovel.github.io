Tianmanfeng, Internal Affairs Hall.

Jiang Yuebai was waiting at the outer gate. Although she arrived first, she was driven out because she was a handyman and the disciples who came later to hand in the task were from the inner sect.

After a while, the male disciple from the inner sect finished the task, and the disciple who performed chores sent it out in person.

The disciples who are stationed in the internal affairs hall and specialize in handling trivial matters are all disciples of miscellaneous affairs.
