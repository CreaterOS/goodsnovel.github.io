[Yinhu, February 19th]

Seventeen days ago, Jia Xiuchun sent three people to kill me.

After fighting hard for half a day, fields were destroyed and houses collapsed.

My right arm was broken and I was wounded in thirty-six places. I finally won!

The entrance to the mine has completely collapsed, and no matter how hard it is to get out of the trapped valley, fortunately, no one else can get in.

After half a month of cultivation, elixir can repair internal and external injuries, but it is difficult to repair the bones. It only depends on whether the self-taught medical skills can be repaired.
