【Ugly Cow, the third day of April】

The hole was sealed as it was, and a protective array was laid.

I chose a place with a mountain and a leeward wind to build a bamboo house. There is a bamboo forest on one side and grass on the other.

The plant essence beads are fed to the ice beetle king, and the grass ash is accumulated. When the bamboo house is built, it can be used to reclaim the spiritual fields for composting.

This place is not suitable for growing spiritual grains, you can try spiritual wheat, there are still many seeds in Grandpa's storage bag.
