【Noon Horse, September 15th】

The disciples of Guiyuan Sword Sect were about to leave, Zhuo Qingfeng came to look for me in exchange for Jianwan.

I told Zhuo Qingfeng that no matter how strong the wind-chasing sword intent is, it is someone else's way after all, and one who comprehends one's own way is the real strong.

Zhuo Qingfeng thought it made sense, so he left.

I gave him a basket of spiritual vegetables from Huaxi Valley, a jug of wine and two spiritual fishes, and told him to bring them back to make them fresh and not put them in storage bags.
