There are thirty-six artifacts hidden in Yuqiuchi's treasure box, each with its own merits, which makes people overwhelmed. At the same time as Xiong Kuan's fierce battle in the late foundation establishment period, he can also suppress the other mid-stage foundation establishment period so as not to lose the wind.

In the late stage of foundation establishment, Gu Liu used the leaf picking sword in one hand, combined with the flying sand and stone movement technique, to fight against two mid-stage foundation establishments, and they were evenly matched.
